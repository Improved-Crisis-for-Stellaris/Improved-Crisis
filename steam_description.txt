Vanilla AI is off for main crises and all fleet movements are mod scripted, this includes military fleets, constructors, army transports, swarm infestors and colossi.

Dimensional Anchors are visible on galactic map.

- Full support for Contingency, Prethoryn Scourge, Unbidden, Aberrant and Vehement. Optional for Gray Tempest, Katzenartig Imperium and other custom crises.
- New custom pathfinding accounting for wormholes and gateways
- Fleets are relentless and always seek targets.
- Defensive fleet recall for Contingency worlds (optional).
- Crisis Manager (optional).
- Galactic empires receive initial massive damage penalty against crisis factions so new technologies need to be obtained in order to mitigate this (optional).
- Crisis colossi (optional).
- Dynamic Mod Menu support with menu access permission management for multiplayer.
- Various fixes related to crises.
List of features is subject to change.

[h1]Load order[/h1]
The mod is load order independent as it uses LIOS/FIOS overwrite methods where needed, but preferably at the bottom. Aggressive Crisis Engine overwrites very little but what is does is crucial for it to work.

[h1]Additional mod support[/h1]
ACEMOD configuration menu opens on game start. In order to access menu after start of the game you can use one or more of the following mods:

[h1]Improvements[/h1]

[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/Qsf8oBs.png[/IMG]

ACEMOD is flexible and modular. Users are able to switch individual components on and off on game start.

Modders can use ACEMOD AI for their own custom country_types and exclude individual fleets from ACEMOD AI for their own events. Current list of effects for modders to use is inside [b]acemod_fleet_events.txt[/b]. See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url] for details.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod is highly compatible but requires disabling vanilla crisis AI. For this reason make sure ACEMOD overwrites any mods which change crises (this includes Starnet AI and Glavius AI).

See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url] if you want to get technical.

[h1]Mod merging info[/h1]
When merging mods for personal use by [url=https://bcssov.github.io/IronyModManager/]Irony Mod Manager[/url], [url=https://winmerge.org/]WinMerge[/url] or some other way, please make sure [b]ai = { }[/b] block has [b]enabled = no[/b]. Otherwise ACEMOD AI will be overwritten by vanilla AI and won't work properly. For list of overwrites see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url].

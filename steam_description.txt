[h1]Load order[/h1]
The mod is load order independent as it uses LIOS/FIOS overwrite methods where needed, but preferably at the bottom. Aggressive Crisis Engine overwrites very little but what is does is crucial for it to work.

[h1]Additional mod support[/h1]
ACEMOD configuration menu opens on game start. In order to access menu after start of the game you can use one or more of the following mods:

[h1]Improvements[/h1]

[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/Qsf8oBs.png[/IMG]

ACEMOD is flexible and modular. Users are able to switch individual components on and off on game start.

Modders can use ACEMOD AI for their own custom country_types and exclude individual fleets from ACEMOD AI for their own events. Current list of effects for modders to use is inside [b]acemod_fleet_events.txt[/b]. See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url] for details.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod is highly compatible but requires disabling vanilla crisis AI. For this reason make sure ACEMOD overwrites any mods which change crises (this includes Starnet AI and Glavius AI).

See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url] if you want to get technical.

[h1]Mod merging info[/h1]

Vanilla AI is off for main crises and all fleet movements are mod scripted, this includes military fleets, constructors, army transports and swarm infestors.

Galactic empires receive initial massive damage penalty against crisis factions. New technologies are required to be obtained in order to mitigate this.

[h1]Load order[/h1]
At the very bottom. Aggressive Crisis Engine overwrites very little but what is does is crucial for it to work.

[h1]Hotfix[/h1]
There is an optional  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2363424291]Modifiers Hotfix for Aggressive Crisis Engine[/url] which will make empire modifiers like Enemy Unknown (damage penalty to crisis factions) work again. It is not essential for ACEMOD to work, this is only needed if you want damage modifiers working until Paradox fixes LIOS overwrite bug.

[h1]Additional mod support[/h1]
ACEMOD configuration menu opens on game start. In order to access menu after start of the game you can use one or more of the following mods:

[h1]Improvements[/h1]

ACEMOD is flexible and modular. Users are able to switch individual components on and off on game start.

Modders can use ACEMOD AI for their own custom country_types and exclude individual fleets from ACEMOD AI for their own events. Current list of effects for modders to use is inside [b]acemod_fleet_events.txt[/b]. See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url] for details.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod is highly compatible but requires disabling vanilla crisis AI. For this reason put ACEMOD below any mod which changes crises (this includes Starnet AI and Glavius AI which overwrite crisis definitions without actually making changes to them).

ACEMOD gives Dimensional Anchors FTL inhibitors and makes them visible on a galactic map. Position ACEMOD below any mod which adds components or ship types.

See [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2268189539/3011179244472319574/]AI framework documentation (modders)[/url] if you want to get technical.

[h1]Crisis AI[/h1]
- Full support for Contingency, Prethoryn Scourge, Unbidden, Aberrant and Vehement.

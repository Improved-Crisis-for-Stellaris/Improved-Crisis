AI framework documentation (modders)

Aggressive Crisis Engine AI can be applied to any empire if a modder desires to. It is [b]highly preferable[/b] to disable vanilla AI first, otherwise fleet commands will most likely be overridden by vanilla AI.

Currently the only way to disable AI is to edit country type file and set [b]enabled = no[/b] in the [b]ai = { }[/b] block as there is no disable AI effect on country/fleet/ship scope. You might want to try to disable individual components and modules but I received mixed results. Feel free to experiment and tell me the outcome, please.

You can always view the source code online at:

Effects are listed in /events/acemod_fleet_events.txt (always up to date) and in the post below (might be out of date).

[h1]Fleet logic structure:[/h1]
Fleet logic is separated into chains of events (modules), one chain for each fleet (ship) type:
shipclass_military
shipclass_constructor
shipclass_transport
shipclass_colonizer
shipclass_military_special

Chains are similar between the classes, but vary, depending on the specific requirements for the class.

[h2]Main event[/h2]
Main fleet type event will trigger (monthly) only when ACEMOD AI is globally on. Effects on executing include iterating through every ACEMOD assisted country which is not specifically excluded from having given fleet type assisted. It will then fire fleet events for given class of fleets, but only if those fleets weren't specifically excluded and are idle (have no queued commands).

[h2]System event[/h2]
Fleets proceed to seek valid target within the system. This might include:
- a valid target to be bombarded (shipclass_military)
- primary star to construct starbase on in a system without owner (shipclass_constructor)
- valid invasion target (shipclass_transport)
- valid colonisation target in a system owned by fleet owner (shipclass_colonizer)
- valid planet killer target (shipclass_military_special)

[h2]Bypass event[/h2]
Fleet without valid target in the system might attempt to cross bypass (wormhole, gateway) if one exists in it.

[h2]Target seeking event[/h2]
Fleets which did not find valid target in the system and did not cross bypass will proceed to seek accessible (i.e. not behind FTL inhibitor)  target on a galactic map.
- shipclass_military: nearest system owned by a hostile,
- shipclass_constructor: nearest unowned system without hostiles,
- shipclass_transport: nearest system with a planet which is a valid invasion target,
- shipclass_colonizer: nearest owned system with valid colonisation target, and without hostiles,
- shipclass_military_special: nearest friendly shipclass_military fleet which is not excluded.

[h1]Implementation into other mods[/h1]

ACEMOD sets up a global flag [b]acemod_installed[/b] which in itself does nothing but other mods can check against it to see if the mod is present.

[h2]Applying AI to a country[/h2]
Global flag [b]acemod_activated[/b] gates off entirety of ACEMOD fleet logic. Without it no fleet movements are made. It is not present on default (ACEMOD AI is OFF) and only switches on when crisis arrives. Modder has to manually set it up if he intends to use ACEMOD AI with custom country.

To enable ACEMOD AI for your country simply apply country flag [b]acemod_assisted_ai[/b] (and the global flag above). Please note that vanilla AI should be disabled. See initial notes on editing country types.

Please keep in mind that disabling AI by setting [b]enabled = no[/b] in the [b]ai = { }[/b] section will disable ALL of the AI, this includes economy AI (planet management, leaders, diplomacy etc). Crisis countries do not have economy so they remain unaffected. Use of ACEMOD AI with countries which have economy [b]*is not supported*[/b].

Aggressive Crisis Engine AI is a crisis AI (it's in the name), not a default empire AI. Applying it to a typical empire will result in a tactical and strategic disaster.

[h2]Tweaking fleet logic[/h2]
Modder can flip ACEMOD AI exclusion on a fleet/ship/country scope if they want to stop ACEMOD from issuing commands to a given scope. See country_piloted_exclusion effects in the effects list. From a technical standpoint a variable of value 1 is applied which is checked against before executing any command. See acemod_scripted_effects.txt.

Example use:
1. Modder finds desired fleet and executes [b]acemod_set_fleet_piloted_exclusion_on = yes[/b] effect on it.
2. Modder uses fleet as seen fit, as ACEMOD AI won't touch excluded fleet.
3. Modder applies [b]acemod_set_fleet_piloted_exclusion_off = yes[/b] effect to remove exclusion. Fleet will proceed as normal.

[h2]Disabling individual modules[/h2]
Given fleet types can also be excluded from control by ACEMOD AI. For example [b]acemod_country_flag_disabled_constructor_ai[/b] will stop ACEMOD from issuing commands to constructors on a country scope. Modder will have to take care of these excluded fleet types in one way or another.

[h2]Overwriting ACEMOD[/h2]
Any overwrites of ACEMOD files or individual components might affect mods which use ACEMOD AI framework. Please be considerate to other mod authors and mod users and disclose any overwrites on your mod page, preferably with technical details.

Using exclusion effects for a ship/fleet/country scope should provide a lot of flexibility so always consider if these would do instead of an overwrite. Feel free to copy and modify fleet logic code. A clone of an ACEMOD fleet event combined with exclusion effect can save on overwrite.

If there is a feature you think cannot be implemented with exclusion effects and without overwrite just ask, I might be able to accomodate or find a solution.

If you *really* have to do overwrite: remember that you can overwrite individual events instead of the whole file.

---

[h1]Additional fleet actions[/h1]
Override of default fleet movements can happen on:
- Critical system wormhole station fleet recall (on_entering_system_fleet acemod_fleet.610)
- Territorial defense actions (on_space_battle_lost acemod_fleet.130) 
- Pinging nearby systems (acemod_fleet.150 monthly random chance)

[h2]Wormhole recall[/h2]
Can be enabled and disabled for a country and on a global scope. Requires setting up a critical system. Refer to acemod_defensive_jumpdrive_protocol list of effects.

[h2]Territorial defense actions[/h2]
This is a functionality always enabled for main crisis factions but any critial fleets can be marked as triggers (acemod_fleet_flag_starbase_defensive_protocol). Response will trigger for any country with acemod_assisted_ai. You can globally disable this feature to save a little bit on performance via country flag (acemod_country_flag_starbase_defensive_protocol_disabled) or global flag (acemod_advanced_ai_disabled). Refer to list of effects.

[h2]Pinging nearby systems[/h2]
Fleets will ping at random chance nearby systems in order to find valuable targets which happen to be too close. This can be disabled via country flag (acemod_country_flag_system_pings_disabled) or global flag (acemod_advanced_ai_disabled). Refer to list of effects.

[h2]Merging fleets[/h2]
Fleets will merge under certain conditions. Action invoked by acemod_custom_on_action_merge_fleets custom on_action.
